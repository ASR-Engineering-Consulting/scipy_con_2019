# GPU Data Science

> Okay, so they are giving us cloud IP addresses to log into, so I may not have much to share here, except my notes.

## Notes

* Fun! They provide a cloud instance for everyone in the room, so we can play with a machine with sufficient GPU power.
* The old solution: Hadoop, but that had too much IO. So people moved to Spark.
* RAPIDS is Nvidia's GPU architecture
* RAPIDS uses Apache Arrow (which tries to standardize the storage of columnar data in memory)
